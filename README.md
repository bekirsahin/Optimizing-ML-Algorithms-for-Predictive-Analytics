# COVID-19 Resource Allocation Project

## Overview
This project aims to address the challenge of efficiently allocating medical resources to COVID-19 patients during both normal and resource-constrained times. By leveraging machine learning techniques and anonymized patient data provided by the Mexican government, we seek to develop predictive models capable of accurately assessing the medical needs of COVID-19 patients based on their symptoms, status, and medical history.

## Project Structure
- **Data Exploration**: Explore the dataset to understand its structure, features, and distributions.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Prepare the data for modeling by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
- **Model Development**: Employ various machine learning algorithms to build predictive models for resource allocation.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Calculate relevant metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model performance.
- **Recommendations**: Provide recommendations based on model insights for resource allocation strategies.
- **Technical Appendix**: Detailed documentation of the data preprocessing steps, model development, and evaluation methodologies.
